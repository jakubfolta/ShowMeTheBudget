# Show Me The Budget
Simple app where you can add your incomes, expenses for given month and your available budget will be displayed on the screen. You can also delete items from the list. IMPLEMENTING LOCAL STORAGE IS IN PROGRESS... After that I want to add next features like button to delete all items from the list and local storage, and connection with outer API to change the quote in center of the screen every day...
